INTRODUCTION
------------

Current Maintainer: Ned <http://drupal.org/user/798324>

WARNING: This module is under development and not intended for production use.  In particular, this module provides "command-line" and unlimited PHP access to users, so it should be tested with great caution.  I hope to get to a publicly-usable development version by Fall 2011.

This Drupal module provides very basic management of external jobs by leveraging Webform for building argument forms.  It is the very beginnings of a CI (Continuous Integration) platform - an attempt to reimplement some of what Jenkins does in Drupal.


INSTALLATION
------------

This should outline a step-by-step explanation of how to install the
module.

0. This is all experimental -- please provide feedback so I can fix bugs!
1. Requires the Webform module
2. Install and enable as usual, see http://drupal.org/node/70151 for further information.


TODO LIST
------------

I am marking known todos in the code with "XXX" so it is easy to grep for them.
